functional requirments 

I want to create a learning buddy 
i am attending astrology classes, in which the teacher teaches and i take notes, i want to create a system
where i can upload an image (with my notes) and the system is able to scan and extract text /tables/highlighted points from the photo
and then present it into a nice format 

so from the top i should be able to add a course, i should be able to add more than 1 course 
for each course i should be able to create like sessions (so the idea is that i will log all the notes by session/classes)
then in a particular session i should be able to upload multiple images and it should be able to scan them and then create nice notes for me. if there is a table it should create a table and add all values correctly. 

it should show the content in editable format and once i save then it should be able to save. i should be able to edit the cntent anytime i want 

do we need LLM for this or can we do with python Libraries 

the toold should work on mobile i am thinking to use react/nodejs/python (if required?)

We can store these images in public/

We start with database and then backend and then frontend 

please come up with an approach note - only 1 document which should have entire project understanding, plan, checklist phase wise
